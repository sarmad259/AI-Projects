## Introduction
Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, especially among children and the elderly. Early and accurate detection of pneumonia is crucial for timely treatment and better patient outcomes. This project focuses on revolutionizing pneumonia detection through advanced deep learning methods, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), deployed in specialized software for swift and accurate analysis of chest X-ray images.

## Motivation
- Healthcare Advancements
- Technological Innovation
- Cost-Effective Diagnosis
- Enhancing Medical Awareness
- Potential for Further Research and Development

## Problem Statement
Manual interpretation of chest X-rays for pneumonia detection is slow and error-prone, especially in busy healthcare settings. This project targets the development of a deep learning-based system for rapid and accurate pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images to enhance patient outcomes and alleviate the burden on healthcare providers.

## Solution
- Upload Chest X-ray Image Preprocessing
- Apply Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Automated Pneumonia Detection

## Data Preprocessing
- Dataset: Utilized the NIH Chest X-rays
- Includes 112,120 frontal view X-ray images.
- Represents 32,717 unique patients.
- Labeled with 14 labels, including pneumonia.

## Challenges & Solutions
- Addressed data imbalance through oversampling of the positive class (pneumonia) and undersampling of the negative class.

## Model Architecture
- Used VGG Model architecture for its proven effectiveness in image classification tasks.
- Fine-tuned the VGG model on the NIH Chest X-ray dataset.
- Incorporated additional layers to enhance model performance.

## Goals
- Achieve a high accuracy.
- Achieve good real-time detection performance.
- Creation of a user-friendly interface.
- Document the complete development process.
